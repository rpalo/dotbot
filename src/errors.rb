        ðŸ’€  No configuration found!  ðŸ’€
        -----------------------

        Dotty looks for configuration first in ~/.dotty.  This is a YAML
        file.  See the docs for more info.  If no ~/.dotty is found,
        it also looks for environment variables starting with DOTTY, such
        as DOTTY_DIR.

      <<~HEREDOC
        ðŸ’€  Target file not found!  ðŸ’€
        -----------------------

        It looks like #{filename} couldn't be found.

  class GitError < DottyError

        ðŸ’€  Git experienced an issue  ðŸ’€
        ----------------------------

        For some reason git was unable to complete the '#{message}' operation.
        Make sure your configured Dotty directory is a git repo that has
        a remote configured.  Make sure you can git push and git pull from
        that directory before running '#{message}' again.
